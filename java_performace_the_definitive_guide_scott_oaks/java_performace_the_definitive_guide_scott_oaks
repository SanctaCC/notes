## Introduction
* this material applies to Java 7 update 40 and Java 8 initial release
* enable JVM flag: `-XX:+FlagName`
* disable JVM flag: `-XX:-FlagName`
* setting a parameter for a flag: `-XX:FlagName=something`
* flags have defaults which depend on platform and other command-line arguments to the JVM
* *ergonomics* - process of automatically tuning flags based on the environment
* classes of machines: "client" and "server" - depends on environment
* performance of Java code depends on:
  * writing good algorithms
  * writing less code (the more code the longer compilation will take, more classes to load, more garbage collecting etc.)
  * optimize code early: Donald Knuth "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time; premature optimization is the root of all evil." means to write clean straightforward code that is simple to read and understand. Don't change algorithm and design to more complicated before profiling the program and being sure that they are really needed. However avoid constructs that are know for bad performance. Every line of code involves a choice, and if there is a choice between two simple, straightforward ways of programming, choose the more performant one. Example: logger and string concatenation done even when logger will not write this string to file/console.
  * look at other components: database, application server, backend server etc.
  * optimize for common case:
    * use profiler and focus on operations taking the most time
    * consider more likely bugs first: performance bug in new code > configuration of machine > bug in JVM or operating system
    * optimize what is used the most by users
